Linux DNS tools via Web Site

You will need to make sure the following binaries are installed:

* nc
* traceroute
* whois
* dig
* ping

You will need to tweak your php.ini to get [Browser detection](http://php.net/manual/en/function.get-browser.php#refsect1-function.get-browser-notes) to work.

Maybe some other tweaks...
